# Data Reporting in R: Statistical Tests on Physical Metrics Dataset

STAT1378 Coding and Communication in Statistics Individual Project (2021)

This project focused on reproducible data reporting and statistical testing of demographic and health metrics (height, weight, physical activity, gender) using a complete R project structure.

## Key Tasks
- Tested linear relationship between height and weight  
- Performed group comparison on mean height by gender (t-test)  
- Analyzed association between gender and physical activity (chi-square)  

## Skills Demonstrated
- R project structure and reproducible workflows  
- Statistical hypothesis testing and data summarization  
- Data organization, validation, and reporting  
- Clear documentation of analytical processes  

## Submission Details
- Full original R project folder structure uploaded as zip for reproducibility  
- Unzip STAT1378-Individual-Project.zip to view folders (R/, data/, tests/, vignettes/, etc.), scripts, metadata, and project file
