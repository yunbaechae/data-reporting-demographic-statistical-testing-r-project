# Data Reporting in R: Statistical Tests on Physical Metrics Dataset

STAT1378 Coding and Communication in Statistics Individual Project (2021)

This project focused on reproducible data reporting and statistical testing of demographic metrics (height, weight, activity, gender) using a complete R project structure.

## Key Tasks
- Tested linear relationship between height and weight  
- Performed group comparison on mean height by gender  
- Analyzed association between gender and physical activity  

## Skills Demonstrated
- R project structure and reproducible reporting workflows  
- Statistical hypothesis testing and data summarization  
- Data organization, validation, and clear documentation  

## Submission Details
- Full R project folder structure preserved for reproducibility  
- **vignettes/articles/** folder is the key documentation hub: contains original R Markdown source (STATProject.Rmd), rendered HTML/PDF outputs, and bibliography — used to store and present all analysis code, explanations, and results in a report-style format.  
- Explore folders (R/, data/, tests/, vignettes/, etc.) for complete project.
